# NoString - Founding Document

*Sovereign communications for life — and beyond.*

---

## The Vision

Your Nostr keypair is your identity. When you die, what happens to it?

NoString answers this question. It's not just another encrypted messenger — it's a complete sovereign communications stack with inheritance built in.

### The Core Insight

With NoString, you build in time-locked key release. If you don't check in for 30 days, 60 days, whatever threshold you set — your designated heirs automatically get access.

The email component is crucial here. Emails are archival by nature. Your entire communication history, encrypted at rest, sitting on whatever email server you use. When the deadman switch triggers, your heir gets the keys to decrypt everything. Not just your Bitcoin, but your correspondence, your relationships, your context.

### Shamir's Secret Sharing

Split the inheritance key across multiple trusted people. Three of five family members need to come together to unlock dad's communications. That's way more robust than a password in a safe deposit box.

The infrastructure stays running — it's self-hosted. Heirs don't need to set anything up. They just need the key(s).

### What NoString Becomes

Sovereign communications now, plus a complete digital inheritance solution.

Your keys, your messages, your legacy — all handled without trusting a corporation to stick around or hand over your data.

## Core Principles

1. **One identity** — Nostr keypair for everything (chat, email, inheritance)
2. **No phone numbers** — Pubkey is identity, no telecom dependency
3. **Self-hosted** — Your infrastructure, your rules
4. **Archival** — Email provides long-term storage that chat doesn't
5. **Inheritance-native** — Death and succession are first-class features
6. **Trustless timelocks** — Bitcoin-secured, not corporate promises
